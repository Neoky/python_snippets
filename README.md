# Snippets
I was taking some boot camps that I found to be a lot of fun. They brought out some good challenges that helped me learn some Python tricks I wouldn't normally have self-taught.

## circle.py

Little python challenge about how to use classes.

* First was to make a basic class that can set different attributes based on the value of a single attribute.
* Update the other attributes when one is changed.
* Raise a ValueError if a bad value is entered.
